//Which one is better?
//What is better? Speed, less memory-intensive? Most legible?
//Depends on the project, but speed and memory is most important

//You can check the speed of your code-- not very reliable though, because every machine will compute these functions differently 
  //The SAME machine can record time differently too so there's that
//It can also difficult to quantify

//Instead of computing the amount of seconds that it takes for a function to run, we can count the amount of operations that are happening.

//There are 3 calculations/simple operations that are happeniong in addUpToTwo2

//In addUpToZTwo, there are n operations. We don't want to focus on how many operations this one does, because it changes as n changes since this function contains a LOOPY LOOP. That's kind of aweful!
//If n is 20, we'd loop over 20 -- 20 times. ðŸ™€ðŸ™€ðŸ™€
