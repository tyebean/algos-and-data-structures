// ***** PROBLEM SOLVING STEPS RECAP *****
// *-------------------------------------*
// * Make sure you understand the problem
// ask questions
// understand inputs/outputs
// cover edgecases/errors
// "what if a user provides an invalid input?"
// understand how your solution should function
// * Explore Concrete Examples
// start with simple examples
// make a bite-sized version of your function, inoput, and output. 
// Ex.
// "Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string."
charCount("hello") // {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}
// Progress to more complex examples
  // explore examples with empty inputs
// * Break it Down
// stub ub a function
// doesn't have to be complete pseudocode
// just write little comments
// know where you're going before you start coding
// clear up any misunderstandings
// * Solve and Simplify
// if you're not sure about a specific part, ignore it
// work on the part that you do know
// ask for clarifications
// plug in the unknown part later
// * Look Back and Refactor
// reflect on your own challange
// use other people's code to see how it could be better
// take note of whether or not your solution was the best
  // mention/point to other solutions that could be better in a time/space complexity sense
